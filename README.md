# Overview
This repo contains a daily programming training in go.

# Aim
For every training I want to tests and the structure of the program self-explaining 
enough so that you can implement it.
Additionally there can be README.md file explaining more...

# Next Practice
- "Plausible" text generator (fed with a source to generate text)

# Open ideas
Here is a collection of little projects waiting to be implemented:
- Hfavtafl
- Shunting-yard calculator
- "Plausible" text generator (fed with a source to generate text)
- 15 min challenge: [Sorting algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)
- sliding puzzle solver
