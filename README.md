# Overview
This repo contains programming challenge ideas / a daily challenge in go.
I hope there are some for you...

# Get started
Clone the repo locally:
`go get github.com/Holzwurmi`
Go into the projects directory:
`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Holzwurmi/steadygo`
Run the small helper:
`go run help.go`

# Aim
For every challenge I want the existing tests and comments in the code to be
self-explaining in a degree that you complete it only with additional help of
golangs [language spec](http://golang.org/pkg/#stdlib).

Try to not add additional imports.

# Next Practice
- "Plausible" text generator (fed with a source to generate text)

# Open ideas
- Hfavtafl
- Shunting-yard calculator
- "Plausible" text generator (fed with a source to generate text)
- 15 min challenge: [Sorting algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)
- sliding puzzle solver
- Simple compression and decompression - minimal data footprint
- your ideas â€¦
